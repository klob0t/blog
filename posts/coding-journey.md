whenever i saw some programmer online doing livestream while making an app or some working-from-home-coding-bros that seems like they have their life sorted out. wake up => coffee => work-out => code. (it's always in that order). 

### i wanted to be like THAT.

> upon making this, i remember that i tried to code back in 2018, that time i tried learn [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) 


not to mention, the salary or payout that (they say) they got each month is quite i n t e r e s t i n g. you've probably seen some videos on how to be a computer scientist/programmer without having a degree and make (insert ridiculous amount of money here).

and on top of that, these days we can't be separated from programs in our daily life. if you think about it, the only time you are not on some type of program is when you are sleeping (even your sleep is probably got interrupted by a program). i think it's nice to understand how the things that we use everyday works.

but, just like everything good, to achieve it won't be easy. especially that i'm coming from a mechanical engineering background (to be clear, i got some programming lecture when i was in college but it's not much, which shouldn't be like that, i think we need to add a bit more programming within MechEng). and knowing that i'm often lose the curiosity to master something along the way of learning it once i know basic stuff. so, i need to find something that would keep me motivated. it should be easy enough, but not only scratching the surface. and importantly, it needs to look COOL. and with that i began looking...




*now i know the difference between: coding AND scripting*
