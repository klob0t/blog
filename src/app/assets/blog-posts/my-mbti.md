I just took another Myers-Briggs test, and I was quite shocked by how accurate the result is.

*Note: Take this with a grain of salt.*

The last time I took the MBTI test was in 2020, literally one week before the COVID-19 pandemic. According to [them](https://16personalities.com/), I was an INFP-T, and I was like, "Okay, I guess that's who I am." With that, I took on the mantle of being an INFP-T. Fast forward to 2024, my [girlfriend](https://instagram.com/muthiabc) took the test (she's an ENFJ-T, by the way), and she encouraged me to take another test for myself. So I did...

> as you can see, now i'm an **INTP-T**.

But what exactly do those letters mean? Here we go:

1. **I - Introvert**, well you know introvert. We charge our energy by being all by ourselves. (It does not mean we don't want to meet people though.)
2. **N - iNtuitive**, we tend to focus on ideas and possibilities, rather than real facts and details. I have mixed responses to this though, as I am quite evidence-based type of person.
3. **T - Thinking**, we value logic more than feeling and personal opinion. Everything has to make sense to us.
4. **P - Perceiving**, we like to do things spontaneously, with little to no planning so we can adapt and come up with ideas on the spot.
5. **T - Turbulent**, this last letter means we tend to be self-doubting (I felt that 😔), perfectionistic, and self-critical. Ugh, so accurate.

But then you might ask, how do these letters actually affect our daily lives? How we interact with other living beings and inanimate objects? How we handle situations? Well, the website gave a 5-page answer which was really accurate to my case.

Let's start with the first page...
## Introduction
The first page of the result is filled with an analysis of how a personality does their thinking inside. This page tells us about the inner workings of an INTP-T. What I can summarize from this page is:

As an INTP, our mind is constantly buzzing with questions and won't stop thinking about everything. And sometimes these thoughts take over to the point that we start to ignore the world around us. We would like to express an apology to all of the people having a conversation with us, sometimes we drift off from what you were saying because we were busy with our thoughts, it's not because you are not interesting. It's just we can't control these streams of thoughts... **ごめんなさい**.

We really enjoy our time alone for us to have a deep dive into our own thoughts and interests without distractions. That's why most of us are night owls. If you look into our YouTube searches, you will find all sorts of things there, from internet mysteries to how to bake a cake to motorcycle restoration. But it doesn't mean that we hate to have an exchange with other people. If you can match our curiosity, then you are my favorite person. Only extensive socializing quickly drains us.

We often overthink small decisions to the point of feeling stuck or ineffective because we have this trait to analyze patterns, discrepancies, and irregularities that others might have missed.

Despite all good intentions, we often struggle to identify and express ourselves effectively (even to ourselves). Human behavior and emotion remain mystifying to us. I remember, my girlfriend once said, "...there are some things that could not be explained merely by logical thinking."

Knowing these, I can work on balancing these traits to be the best version of myself. It's still a long way from mastering it though.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

From the paragraph above, the result page concluded some of the strengths and weaknesses of an INTP-T:

### Strengths:

1. Analytical
2. Original
3. Open-Minded
4. Curious
5. Honest

### Weaknesses:

1. Disconnected
2. Insensitive
3. Dissatisfied
4. Overthinkers
5. Impatient

The next page is about romantic relationships. I'll keep this to myself and my partner, he he he he.

## Friendships

We are selective about who becomes our close friends. Our best friends tend to be someone who shares similar passions for exploring ideas, theories, and concepts. But don't get it wrong, it is not because we don't like you. We respect every human being from every walk of life (at least that's what I am feeling).

We only have a few friends within our already small circle. And it doesn't matter because it is actually what we wanted.

We value our friends a lot. When they come to us with problems, we are more than eager to provide help. Well, logical advice mostly... We will be overwhelmed, though, with offering emotional support.

For us, friendships are more than just seeing superficial traits; we look past that to appreciate people's full potential.

## Career Paths

OK, this is the part where I really want to express myself because looking for a job that suits us is quite hard, and now I finally know why.

Conventional work environments are often not designed with INTPs in mind. OK, this might sound controversial, like, "Well, it is a job! It won't be comfortable for anyone." I know. We know where to draw the line, but in this modern world, it would be nice to have more options when it comes to our career, right?

However, I can guarantee you that we as INTPs will thrive if we were given the opportunity to explore theories, solve complex problems (mind you, we only want complex problems), and exercise our creativity on a daily basis. What suits us best is careers in the fields of engineering, technology, sciences, etc. **Routine administrative work bores us.**

We are not quite impressed by the conventional workplace incentives like impressing bosses, coworker acceptance, or having power over others. It's nice to get some praise for our work, but that's what our mind is set on.

While not naturally inclined toward roles requiring major social interactions, we won't shy away if we have to present our ideas to the public or have to work together towards a common goal. Remember, we love to have someone with similar passions and goals.

> Our innovative thinking and problem-solving abilities are invaluable assets in any career if they can get past initial impressions (contact me, recruiters!)

That's basically who I am, my whole personality summarized in 5 pages by 16personalities, and I had to agree on some of their points. But then again, take this with a grain of salt, as MBTI is often seen as pseudoscience. But as long as you are filling out the questionnaire as honestly as possible (or maybe have someone give a second opinion), it should not be too far from what you actually are.

I encourage you to also take the test, and maybe you could understand yourself a lot better!
